Offline Messages
================
A new code was added to handle sending of offline messages, thanx to a patch from Ankit.
The behaviour of that patch, is to send an offline message when a user isnot marked as online in the buddylist. In fact, this can be problematic, since on the yahoo servers, the buddylist are often not refreshed properly.
However, when they're working properly, the global behaviour is better.
But, as soon as libyahoo is fixed to work properly, maybe with newer protocol, this behaviour should be re-examined.
Here's the patch that was applied to ChatSession.cpp (new is "<", old is ">"):
<
<   BuddyStatus *status = main_window->getBuddyStatus((char*)((const char*)to));
<   if(status->available())
<       yahoo_cmd_msg(context, (const char*)main_window->current_user(),
---
>
>   yahoo_cmd_msg(context, (const char*)main_window->current_user(),

<   else
<       {
<          _chatWindow->appendMessage("User not online. Sent as an offline message.",(const char*)to);
<          yahoo_cmd_msg_offline(context,(const char*)main_window->current_user(),
<               (const char*)to,(const char*)msg);
<       }
