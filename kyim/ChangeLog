Fixed bugs 131964, 131962, 131971. (Sound paths not initialzing right,
migration path to new kyahoorc, and saving initial configuration.)
0.5
===============
Fixed resizing bug.. forget to finish that before releasing 0.4
Hacked around the "<>" missing in chat window bugs. Converts <> to () instead
of losing them to the html parser.
Converted to using libyahoo straight from the distribuition, now builds
in its own directory and is linked instead. 
Added the "diamond of status" pixmaps to the buddylist, so nwo you have
pretty colors to correspond to the different status levels.
Added option to not dynamically resize the buddylist with each status update.
Fixed conference packet parsing problems.
Fixed offline msg parsing problem.
Added Offline Msg Dialog.
Screened out extra field on status message.

Fixed resizing bug #113289.

===============
Fixed bug 110400 - status updates when windows client had custom message were
repeated. 
Fixed bug 109946 - added includes to aid in solaris compile.
Fixed bug 109934 - KYahoo crashed ugly when the server dropped the connection.

    another user to the conference.
Fixed:
#108022: Bug in conference code, will kick user out of conference
if their status changes to logged out (or invisible, unfortunately). This
handles the case when kyahoo crashes and leaves ghosts in conferences. I
don't believe that The windows client acts this way, so I might take it
out later.

format for when the message was sent.
#109155: Couldn't run KYahoo overnight, the server logged the user
