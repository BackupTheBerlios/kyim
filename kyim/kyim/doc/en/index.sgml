<sect1>How to obtain KYahoo 
<p>
KYahoo is available for download from the KYahoo web page, 
<htmlurl url="http://kyahoo.sourceforge.net" name = "kyahoo.sourceforge.net">.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
KYahoo requires KDE version 2.x and Qt version 2.x.

<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>

In order to compile and install KYahoo on your system, type the following in
the base directory of the KYahoo distribution:

<tscreen><verb>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Since KYahoo uses <verb>autoconf</verb> you should have not trouble
compiling it.
Should you run into problems please report them to the the author at

<sect> Usage <p>

Messenger. Information on that and creating pager accounts is
available at Yahoo's <htmlurl url="http://members.yahoo.com" name =
"site">.
